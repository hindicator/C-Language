Section A :

Answer - Never true.
Proof - The default starting index of an array in C Language is always zero
and there is no way to change this.
Note : With pointers the case is different and there is a way to configure the pointer to be an int array that starts with the index 1
        Even though this is not recommended.


Section B :

Answer - Sometimes true and sometimes isn't true.
Proof - With the following structe

```
struct data
{
    unsigned int a : 1;
    unsigned int b : 32;
    unsigned int c : 1;
};
typedef struct data data_t;

data_t alldata;
```

The command :

```
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(alldata));
```
Output : 12
